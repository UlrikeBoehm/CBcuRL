### Dependencies
Standard python dependencies are required: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`.`yaml` is required to parse parameter files. `argparse` is required for the command line application. `pytest` is required to run the unit tests. If you would like to use the neural network functionality then `TensorFlow` is required, the lookuptable versions of the agents will work without 'TensorFlow'.
